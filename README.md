# Houston House Price Prediction 

## Topic 

We've chosen to analyze and construct a predictive model for housing prices in Houston, TX (MFU/SFU), as well as determining and describing the relationship between the final price and its various input factors.

Given the broad public consensus regarding the instability of the Housing market nationwide, we've chosen this topic in order to determine potentially causal trends and correlations betweeen property metacharacteristics, and to help inform the decision making process for a group member currently seeking to purchase a property in Houston.   
  
## Data 

The data we will be performing analysis on, and which we will use as ML model inputs will consist of the following fields:

- Super Neighborhood Median Household Income
- Super Neighborhood Population
- Property Square Footage
- Property Number of Bedrooms
- Zillow Walk Score
- Zillow Transit Score
- Zillow Bike Score
- Property Price

Data regarding Super Neighborhoods will come from the Houston, TX 2015 Census data, and the follow on demographic descriptions of each Super Neighborhood
as provided by Houston's city website (https://www.houstontx.gov/planning/Demographics/docs_pdfs/SN/Median-Household-Income.pdf).

The remainder of the data will be gathered by scraping the Zillow listings website for all relevant information. The scraping code is included in the repo.

The placing of these properties into their respective super neighborhoods will be accomplished through a pipeline which utilizes GIS representations of Super Neighborhood boundaries from the 2010 census, which upon checking, is still relevant and accurate to their contemporary states (https://koordinates.com/layer/12942-houston-texas-census-by-super-neighborhood-2010/)

## Questions We Can Answer

With this data, we will be able to determine which input factors are most correlated/impactful vis-a-vis final property price, as well as which locales and property characteristics are ideal for purchasing a new property in Houston, TX.

## Database

We used PostGreSQL and Amazon AWS RDS to create the database. This decision was made to use a cloud based database as it allows the team members to access the data at all hours. A local database on a team members computer would limit this team as our work hours are very different. Google colab and spark were used to clean and upload the data. We created two tables from the data gathered and joined these to tables to creat a super_properties table. The super properties table allows us to acces all data from a single table during the machine learning process.

## Machine Learning model

A fitted Linear regression model was used for the machine learning phase. The model was trained to roughly approximate a comparative price metric given property characteristics.
