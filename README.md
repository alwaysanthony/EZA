### Houston House Price Prediction

## Topic

Using ML models, we will be able to predict the price of a house in Houston. This will help a purchaser decide on a house to buy or an area to move to.

## Data

Our housing price data will come from Zillow and we will also use census data to determine population and median income.

## Questions we can answer

We chose this topic because one of our group members is in the market for a new house and wants to make a smart decision.
We will also be able to determine what variables have the most effect on the price of houses.

## Communication Protocols

Each member will work in their own branch and pull requests will be reviewed by Anthony.

We will use PostgreSQL to set up our database. From here our ML model will be able to take in data and predict prices.
